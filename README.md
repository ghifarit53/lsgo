I've tried every `ls` alternative that supports displaying icons, but haven't found one I enjoyed using. Most of them uses true color for the icon, which doesn't look good on the terminal. I prefer them to use the 8 colors that the terminal have. Also I didn't find a way to add custom iconðŸ˜…, oh and they somewhat have too many options, so I thought, why don't try rolling one myself. And here it is `lsi`
